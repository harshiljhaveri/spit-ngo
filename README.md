# NGO
The Main idea was to be able to customize as well as create a one stop portal for the needs of both the NGO and the Citizens who wish to do good and volunteer Our app works as an interface in bringing together the NGOâ€™s and the volunteers to all the help that they need.  We have maintained an easy UI and a more interactive experience in order to attract more citizens to do good. 

To run the project, first install the latest version of eclipse preferably Eclipse Mars or Eclipse Indigo, deploy the project on your eclipse workspace and then click on run. Also have MySQL server up and running on port 3306 with username initialised as "root" and password set to none
